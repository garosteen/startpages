# Startpages

This is a repository for working on various 'startpages' -- i.e., custom webpages that I or others can use as a home page in a web browser.

## Goals

Things I would like my startpage to do:
  - Easily configurable list of bookmarks to jump to
    - Easy means: you should be able to edit a single file with the bookmark name and destination, and shouldn't require much programming knowledge.
  - Present a randomly chosen quote from fortune files
  - Integrate with Firefox's bookmark system, so that it can display either full lists or randomly chosen items from certain bookmark folders, easily configurable.
  - Integrate with another website, for instance LessWrong.com or a specific subreddit or HackerNews to show a randomly suggested article to read.
  - Integrate with RSS feeds of other websites, to show if there are updates
  - Show the most recent xkcd comic
